# <h0blue>Welcome to the Summit 2025 Data for Good Hackathon</h0blue>
In these "Lab Instructions" you will find materials to orient you to geospatial data through a Hands On Lab. 
This material is not related to the hackathon, it's simply a tutorial on geospatial data. If you already went through the information in the Snowflake Quickstarts, you can ignore the material contained in here.

# <h0blue>Hackathon Scenario: Hurricane Ida </h0blue>

In August of 2021 an enormous hurricane, Ida, is gathering strength and bearing down on the Gulf Coast of the United States. The predicted track is veering towards the region of southern Louisiana and the city of New Orleans, which has been the site of large numbers of significant hurricanes over the years, including the worst case scenario event of Hurricane Katrina in 2005\. 

The disaster relief non-profit, **Direct Relief**, is watching the unfolding situation closely in anticipation of the need to respond quickly, accurately, and appropriately to humanitarian medical needs as they occur. The primary role of Direct Relief is to support healthcare systems in times of crisis through shipments of essential medicines and medical supplies, and to act as a grantor during the post-event recovery, in order to make sure that healthcare systems that serve the most vulnerable are able to meet the needs of their patients regardless of who they are or whether they have the ability to pay. 

The Direct Relief analytics team, whom you are supporting, is looking at three phases of data analysis which may be able to support their operational decision making over the course of this event. 

1. In the first phase, focused on **risk and vulnerability analysis** prior to the landfall of the storm, it is important to anticipate where the hurricane will have the greatest impact on people, buildings, health infrastructure, transportation networks, and other vital systems, and to describe the connections between those impacts.   
2. During the second phase, **focused on situational analysis**, it is important to understand events unfolding in real time which indicate how the storm is actually having rapidly changing impacts on the aspects of social life and the built environment which were the focus of the risk analysis.    
3. In the third phase, **focused on post-event evaluation and prioritization** for disaster recovery, it is important to report on the nature of the impacts which occurred so that aid shipments and other resources can be allocated to support the needs of the population.
