# <h0blue>Conclusion</h0blue>  

Congratulations on completing the **Location Analytics Hands-on Lab**! Throughout this session, you've explored how Snowflake can be used to analyze and transform geospatial data, combining multiple datasets to generate valuable insights.  

### <h1sub> Key Takeaways  </h1sub>

- **Fundamentals of Geospatial Analysis in Snowflake**  
  You started by learning how to work with location data in Snowflake, visualizing points on a map and understanding spatial relationships.  

- **Building a Multi-Layer Application**  
  Using Streamlit, you explored how to bring together different layers of geospatial information into an interactive application.  

- **Solar Power Use Case**  
  By analysing rooftop data from multiple locations in the UK, you assessed the potential for solar energy generation, integrating location data with weather insights.  

- **API-Driven Insights**  
  You learned how to retrieve real-time environmental data, such as flood warnings from the UK Environmental Agency API, and overlay this information onto your existing datasets to assess risks.  

### <h1sub>Next Steps</h1sub>  

With this foundational knowledge, you can extend your analyses by:  

- Integrating additional external datasets, such as demographic or economic data, to enhance decision-making.  
- Experimenting with different visualisation techniques to improve data storytelling.  
- Automating geospatial data processing with Snowpark and external APIs.  

We hope this hands-on lab has provided you with the confidence and skills to apply geospatial analytics in your own projects. **Happy analysing!** ðŸš€
